/* 
The clause SELECT tells the DB to return all columns for each row that matches the WHERE clause conditions
The clause FROM "GIRLS" specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. In this case, the table is named "GIRLS"
The clause WHERE introduces the conditions that must be met for a row to be included in the results

Easy to understand, even for those with no prior SQL experience :)
