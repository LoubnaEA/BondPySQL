    SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables
    GROUP BY: Groups rows sharing a property so that aggregate functions can be applied to each group
    ORDER BY: Sorts the result set of a query by one or more columns
    HAVING: Filters groups in the result set created by GROUP BY

DML (Data Manipulation Language): Used to manipulate data within tables
    INSERT INTO: Adds new records to a table
    UPDATE: Modifies existing records in a table
    DELETE FROM: Removes records from a table

DCL (Data Control Language): Manages access to the database (not explicitly used in the provided scripts)
    GRANT: Gives user's access privileges to the database
    REVOKE: Takes back permissions granted to users

TCL (Transaction Control Language): Manages transactions in the database (not explicitly used in the provided scripts)
    COMMIT: Saves the transaction's changes
    ROLLBACK: Reverts the transaction's changes
    SAVEPOINT: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back

Aggregate Functions:
    COUNT(*): Returns the number of rows
    SUM(): Returns the sum of a set of values
    AVG(): Returns the average value
    MAX(): Returns the maximum value
    MIN(): Returns the minimum value

Window Functions:
    LAG(): Accesses data from a previous row in the same result set without using a self-join

Filtering and Sorting:
    WHERE: Filters rows based on a condition
    LIKE: Searches for a specified pattern in a column
